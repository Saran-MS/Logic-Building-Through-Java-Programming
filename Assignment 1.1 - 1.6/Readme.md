<h1>Assignment 1.1</h1>

Return last digit of the given number:

Write a function returns the last digit of the given number. Last digit is being refereed tot the least significant digit i.e. the digit in the one(units) place in the given number.

The last digit should be returned as a positive number.

Make sure you use class and objects.

Example:

Given number = 197, the last digit is 7

Given number = -197, the last digit is 7

<h1>Assignment 1.2</h1>

Return second last digit of the given number:

Write a function that returns the second last digit of the given number. Second last digit is being referred to the digit in the tens place in the given number.

Example:

Given number = 197, second last digit is 9.

Note 1: The second last digit should be returned as a positive number, i.e if the given number is -197, the second last digit is 9.

Note 2: If the given number is a single digit number, then the second last digit does not exist. In such cases, the function return -1,i.e if the given number is 5, the second last digit should be returned as -1.

<h1>Assignment 1.3</h1>

Sum of last digits of two given numbers:

Rohit wants to add the last digits of two given numbers.

Example:

If the given numbers are 267 and 154, the output should be 11.

Explanation:

Last digit of 267=7

Last digit of 154=5

Sum of 7 and 4 =11.

Note: The sign of the input numbers should be ignored i.e,

If the input numbers are 267 and 154, sum of the last two digits should be 11.

If the input numbers are 267 and -154, sum of the last two digits should be 11.

If the input numbers are  -267 and 154, sum of the last two digits should be 11.

If the input numbers are -267 and -154, sum of the last two digits should be 11.


<h1>Assignment 1.4</h1>

Is N an exact multiple of M?

Write a function that accepts two parameters and finds whether the first parameter is an exact multiple of the second parameter.

If the first parameter is an exact multiple of the second parameter, the function should return 2 else it should return 1.

If either of the parameters are zero, the function should return 3.

Assumption: Within the scope of this question, assume that

(i). the first parameter can be positive, negative or zero

(ii). the second parameter will always be >=0

<h1>Assignment 1.5</h1>

Of the given 5 numbers, How many are even?

Write a function that accepts 5 input parameters and returns the count of how many of those 5 are even.

Example:

If the five input parameters are 12,17,19,14 and 115, there are two even numbers 12 and 14. So the function return 2.

Similarly, if the five input parameters are 15,0,-12,19 and 28, there are three even numbers 0,-12 and 28. So the function return 3.

Observe that zero is also considered an even number.

<h1>Assignment 1.6</h1>

Of the given 5 numbers, How many are even or odd?

Write a function that accepts 6 input parameters.

The first 5 input parameters are of type int.

The sixth input parameter is of type string.

If the sixth parameter contains the value "even", the function should return the count of how many of the first five input parameters are even.

If the sixth parameter contains the value "odd", the function should return the count of how many of the first five input parameters are odd.

Example:

If the five input parameters are 12,17,19,14 and 115, and the sixth parameter is "odd",the function should return 3, because there are three odd numbers 17,19 and 115.

If the five input parameters are 12,17,19,14 and 115, and the sixth parameter is "even",the function should return 2, because there are two even numbers 12 and 14.

Note that zero is considered as even number.
