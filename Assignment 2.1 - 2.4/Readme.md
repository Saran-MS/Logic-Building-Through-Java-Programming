<h1>Assignment 2.1</h1>

Is Prime?

Write a function that finds whether the given number N is Prime or not. If the number is prime, the function should return 2 else it return 1.

Assumption: 2<=N=5000, where N is the given number.

Example 1: If the number N is 7, the method must return 2.

Example 2: If the given number N is 10, the method must return 1.

<h1>Assignment 2.2</h1>

Factorial of a number

In maths, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,

5!=5x4x3x2x1=120

4!=4x3x2x1=24

Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.

The given number will be passed to the function as an input parameter of type int. The function is expected to calculate the factorial of the given number and return it as an int type.

Assumptions for this program:

The given input number will always be greater than or equal to 1. Due to the range supported by int, the int numbers will range from 1 to 12.

<h1>Assignment 2.3</h1>

nthFibonacci:

Write a function to return the nth number in the fibonacci series. The value of N will be passed to the function as input parameter.

NOTE: Fibonacci series looks like-

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55...... and so on.

i.e Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and continues generating the next number as the sum of the previous two numbers.

<h1>Assignment 2.4</h1>

Nth Prime

Write a function that finds and return the Nth prime number. N will be passed as input to the function.

Assumption: 1<=N<=1000, where N is the position of the prime number

The first prime number is 2

The second prime number is 3

The third prime number is 5

The fourth prime number is 7

The fifth prime number is 11

.... and so on.

Example 1: If the given number N is 10, the method must return the 10th prime number i.e. 29.

Example 2: If the given number N is 13, the method must return the 10th prime number i.e. 41.
